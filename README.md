Python3 web scraping to download hit mp3 files

I love to listen to music as I drive on the long ways. Radio gets bored and usually hit radio stations are unavailable.
So I wrote this downloading script to fetch hit songs from mp3indirdur.mobi website.  Script downloads top 100 list of turkish hit songs. You can copy ans modify the script according to your needs.
