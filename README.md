Python3 web scraping to download hit mp3 files

I enjoy listening to music while driving long distances. Listening to the radio bores me, and most of the popular radio stations are usually unavailable on the way. So I decided to write this downloader script to fetch hit songs from the "mp3indirdur.mobi" website. The Script downloads the top 100 list of Turkish hit songs. You can copy and modify the script according to your needs.
