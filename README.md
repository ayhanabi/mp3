Python3 web scraping to download hit mp3 files

I love to listen to music as I drive on the long ways. Listening to radios makes me bored and usually most of the hit radio stations are unavailable on the way.
So I decided to write this downloader script to fetch hit songs from "mp3indirdur.mobi" website.  Script downloads top 100 list of turkish hit songs. You can copy and modify the script according to your needs.
